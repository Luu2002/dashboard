# smart-dashboard

Use provided template to create this dashboard. For this dashboard I kept the same idea but want to discover some more information and date. Therefore, the dataset was from USGS where I decide to keep the location of Japan but instead of looking at the Sep 2017. I went into looking at March of 2020 and see for those location how many earthquakes happen in March and how big the earthquakes are in certain areas.
